 * @class MReactionMap
 * @brief MReactionMap can be used to add low latency haptic feedback to
 * applications
 *
 * @details MReactionMap draws a reactive map to shared memory which is used
 * by meegofeedback daemon to provide haptic feedback. The daemon listens to
 * touchscreen events directly from the touchscreen kernel interface and
 * delivers haptic feedback based on the reaction map that has been drawn
 * by MReactionMap. This is done to minimize the latency of the haptic
 * feedback.
 *
 * MReactionMap instance can be constructed after the top-level QWidget of the
 * application has been created. Please note that there can be only one
 * MReactionMap instance per top-level QWidget.
 *
 * After the MReactionMap instance has been created the MReactionMap API can
 * be used to draw on the created reaction map. Any point on the map defines
 * which feedback will be played when the user's finger enters or leaves the
 * display at that point.
